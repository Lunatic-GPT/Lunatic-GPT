- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lunatic-GPT.
- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Vison, Medical Image Analysis, Deep learning inference, and some non-technical topics (such as some PM and Analyst stuff).
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring unsupervised/self-supervised learning in Medical Images.
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on anything (if I can offer some help).
- 📫 You can reach me via my personal email ixuanhang at foxmail.com(remember replace at with `@`) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: Indeed, this is my secondary GitHub repository; my initial account has been rendered inaccessible due to unusual authentication protocols. I am actively engaged in the migration of select content to this new account (a process that may extend over an extended period).
